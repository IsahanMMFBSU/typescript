# Filterable List - TypeScript Edition

This project involves rewriting the asynchronous Filterable List application from JavaScript to TypeScript and addressing all previously noted issues. This README provides an overview of the project, setup instructions, and usage details.

## Project Overview

The Filterable List application allows users to fetch, filter, and display data asynchronously. The primary goal of this project is to enhance the existing JavaScript application by leveraging TypeScript for better type safety and maintainability. Additionally, all issues noted in the comments of the previous version have been addressed.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Data Fetching:** Fetch data from an external API asynchronously.
- **Filtering Capabilities:** Filter the fetched data based on user input.
- **TypeScript Integration:** Improved type safety and code readability.
- **Error Handling:** Robust error handling to manage potential API failures.
- **Modular Architecture:** Separation of concerns with modular code structure.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (for running the development environment)
- npm or yarn (for managing dependencies)

### Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/filterable-list-ts.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd filterable-list-ts
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

5. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser to view the application.

## Usage

1. The application fetches data from an external API and displays it in a list format.
2. Use the input field to filter the list based on specific criteria.
3. The list updates in real-time as you type in the filter input.
